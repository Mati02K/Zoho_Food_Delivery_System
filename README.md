My name is Mathesh and this repository consists of the codebase of Food Delivery System made for Zoho Placement.

## Build Explanation.
1. The Code works by taking input from input.txt file and output the result in output.txt file.
2. Just run the MainActivity.class in the src/mathesh folder after cloning. (Or just follow the below steps)
```console
git clone "https://github.com/Mati02K/Zoho_Food_Delivery_System.git"
cd Zoho_Food_Delivery_System
cd src
cd mathesh
javac MainActivity.java
java MainActivity
```
3. After this step go and check the output.txt file to see the output.
4. If you want to change the input change the input in input.txt based on the format given in the Question PDF.
